## Game description and objectives
![An image](assets/forestoffellowship.jpg) 
The primary concept of this game is that a character has been trapped in a forest and must find their way out, but enemies are endlessly attacking them as they do so. The platformer player must get to the bottom of the screen using the arrow keys to move side to side and jump without touching any opponents. Additionally, they will be helped by a shooter who will defeat the enemies from infiltrating their territory by hitting them with bullets; they can also gain points by doing this, and they are counted in the top left corner of the screen. The game will end when either the platformer gets hit by an enemy, the shooter lets an enemy hit the ground or when the platformer player reaches the podium at the end.

## Core theme
This game's core theme is teamwork. I have deliberately functioned it in a way in which it is easier to play and win the game if there are two players performing their respective functions. In a simplified way of echoing multiplayer video games such as the recent Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I feel as though this helps create a game that is fun for all to play.

## Creative descisions
I had many aspiring ideas when conceptualizing my final project. A platformer game was the topic I had always intended to do; I recognized the challenges that may come when developing a game such as this, especially since I have not done coding with p5.js before. Therefore, I have used many tutorials and starter codes to prepare myself on how to make such a game using the p5 script, and had even considered switching to creating a shooter game if it got too complicated. It was eventually decided that I would combine the two in a unique way that enable a multiplayer aspect, one that would make the game all the more enjoyable. Using tutorials from YouTube videos as a base for my code, I was surprised to learn that it was easy to combine the separat codes for both a platformer and shooting style game in p5.js. However, there were still issues that arose, such as making sure the enemies did not stop falling when the shooter was not hitting them (this was prior to the addition of the 'lose' screen). As a novice to using p5.js, I was challenged several times throughout this game's creation, such as making a collision function for the enemies hitting the platformer player; I overcame these with helps from lecturers and others on my course, which furthered pushed towards making this game reliant on cooperation.

## Reflections
Whilst I am happy with how the game functions, I feel like it could have been improved visually, such as making the platforms look more like grass/dirt, and defining the appearances of the platformer, shooter and enemies. I noticed there is a slight bug with the shooter's bullets I cannot fix, as they only truly work when touching the enemies from the right hand side. Additionally, I feel like a starter screen was crucially required to inform players on the context of the game and what they need to do. If I had more time to develop all of these aspects, I feel like I would be more proud of how this game turned out, but I can take this as a learning curve for the future to be more experienced in using p5.js.
